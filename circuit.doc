THE CIRCUIT

My CPU board follows the circuit described in the HC11 REFERENCE BOOK (available
from Motorola).  Basically it's an HC11 wired in single chip mode. I added a
MAXIM MAX232 to enable RS232 communications with a PC, and a MICROCHIP 25c010
16K serial EEPROM for program storage.

I use a transistor-resistor network to act as a brownout circuit for RESET.
This is the circuit on Motorola's EVB board.  However, if I had it to do again,
I would use a reset chip such as Motorola's MC34064 or Dallas' econo reset
DS1233.  What is important here is that the circuit has a way to reset when
voltage is too low, and a push button reset switch.

To power the circuit, I used 4 AA alkaline batteries, unregulated.  Later. I
added an 78LC05 voltage regulator so I could use 9v batteries and solar power.

There are other chips that will perform the voltage translation that the MAX232
does.  Feel free to use them.  Also, there are other sizes and makes of SPI
format serial EEPROMs.  The software should work with those.  I read recently
that there are 4M byte versions of SPI format serial EEPROMs.  Imagine the
possibilities.

Finally, my original version of SFORTH used a NATIONAL 93C86 2K SEEPROM, which
is in MICROWIRE format.  MICROWIRE is very similar to SPI, in fact I used the
SPI port with a few small software changes.  The code to drive the SEEPROM is
not that much bigger.  I switched to 25C04 because they were cheaper, and easier
to interface.  If you have a good source for NATIONAL MICROWIRE type memories,
you could make this system work with them.  For that matter, I don't see why it
wouldn't work with I2C type SEEPROMs.  The code might be too big, but if you use
enough imagination, it might just work.

CONSTRUCTION

How you build the circuit depends on what you buy.  The HC11 comes in a 52 pin
PLCC package and a 48 pin DIP package.  The 48 pin package is easy to wire wrap.
The 52 pin package is more difficult.  I found a good deal on wire wrap SIP
sockets.  With these I could fashion a wire wrap socket for the 52 pin chip.
It is a tight fit and difficult to keep track of which pin is which, but, it is
easier than the point-to-point solder job I did on the original model.  Of
course, you could buy a PC board for the HC11 through various sources (see
SFORTH.DOC).

A circuit diagram is available in the file CIRCUIT.BMP.  It will work with PAINT
in your WINDOWS APPLICATIONS program.
